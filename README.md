Project name: MOVPE input analyzer

What is metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE)?
Semiconductors form the basis of modern electronic devices such as transistors, diodes and lasers. For example, nitride semiconductors (e.g. GaN/AlGaN, InN) are widely used in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and detectors. The production of nitride semiconductors with desired properties (resistance, sensitivity to light etc.) requires a complex and diligent process. One of the production methods for nitride semiconductors is metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), where epitaxy describes an ordered crystalline growth. This method employs each element (Ga, N, In etc.) in the gas form to build the semiconductor structure. However, the production of group III elements (Ga, In, Al) as gases is a difficult task due to physical reasons, that's why, these elements are bound to metal organic compounds (e.g. Trimethyl-gallium, TMGa). Eventually, the MOVPE method produces the desired nitride semiconductor structure by the reaction of such compounds at various amounts and time intervals. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalorganic_vapour-phase_epitaxy for details.)

What is MOVPE input analyzer?
The MOVPE method consists of various gas bubblers to provide gases, valves to control the flow of these gases and a reactor where the semiconductor structure is formed. In that manner, input of the MOVPE method simply describes the flow of gases, i.e, the amount of gases at certain time intervals. MOVPE input analyzer provides an user friendly handling for these input files. You may see a screenshot from the application above. The gases and valves show the all   

For example, p-type AlN/GaN semiconductor is shown in the figure above.
